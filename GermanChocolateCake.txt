For the cake: based on Stella Park's Devil's food cake recipe

12 ounces unsalted butter (about 3 sticks; 340g)
12 ounces buttermilk (about 1 1/2 cups; 340g)
3 ounces Dutch-process cocoa powder, such as Cacao Barry Extra Brute (about 1 cup, spooned; 85g)
6 ounces finely chopped dark chocolate, roughly 72% (about 1 1/4 cups; 170g)
16 ounces light brown sugar (about 2 cups, packed; 455g)
1/2 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)
1/2 tsp of almond extract
1 teaspoon (4g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
6 large eggs, straight from the fridge (about 10 1/2 ounces; 295g)
3 large egg yolks, straight from the fridge (about 1 1/2 ounces; 45g)
9 ounces all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal (about 2 cups, spooned; 255g)
1 tablespoon (about 13g) baking soda

Getting Ready: 
Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). 
Line three 8- by 3-inch anodized aluminum pans with parchment and grease with pan spray. 
(The cakes can be baked in 2-inch-deep pans, but they will dome more and rise less.)

For the Cake: 
Combine butter and coffee or tea in a 5-quart stainless steel pot or saucier over low heat. 
Once melted, remove from heat, then mix in cocoa and chocolate, followed by brown sugar, vanilla, and salt. 
Mix in eggs and yolks, then sift in flour and baking soda. Whisk thoroughly to combine.
Divide batter between prepared cake pans, using about 23 ounces each. (If you don't have three pans, the remaining batter can be held at room temperature up to 90 minutes, though the rise will not be quite as high.) 
Bake until cakes are firm but your finger can still leave an impression in the puffy crust, about 30 minutes (a toothpick inserted into the center should come away with a few crumbs still attached).

For the Frosting:
4 large egg yolks
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup unsweetened coconut milk
1/4 tsp salt
8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cubed
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp almond extract
1 3/4 cups shredded coconut, toasted to light golden brown (can use sweetened or unsweetened depending on preference)
1 1/2 cups chopped pecans, toasted

In a medium saucepan, cook coconut milk, egg yolks, brown sugar and a pinch of salt over medium heat, whisking at first and then stirring constantly, until the mixture has thickened enough to leave a line on the back of a wooden spoon, 5 to 7 minutes. 
Be careful not to let the mixture curdle. Lower the heat as necessary.
Remove from heat and add the butter, stirring until it has melted. 
Add vanilla and stir to combine. 
Add the milk mixture to the coconut and pecans, stirring to combine. This mixture will thicken slightly as it cools.
